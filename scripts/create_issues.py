Transform the workerpool library by adding comprehensive resource type definitions and monitoring interfaces to support resource-aware scheduling.

## Background
Current worker pools don't understand resource requirements, leading to resource exhaustion in production. This issue establishes the foundation for intelligent resource management.

## Requirements
- [ ] Define all resource type structures (CPU, Memory, IOPS, Network, GPU)
- [ ] Create monitoring interfaces with ResourceMonitor
- [ ] Add unit tests for resource calculations
- [ ] Document resource units and measurements

## Technical Details
**Files to create/modify:**
- `resources/types.go` - Core resource type definitions
- `resources/monitor.go` - Monitoring interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All resource types defined with proper constants
- [ ] ResourceRequirement struct supports all resource types
- [ ] ResourceLimits struct provides comprehensive limits
- [ ] ResourceMonitor interface is well-defined and extensible
- [ ] Unit tests cover all resource calculations
- [ ] Documentation explains resource units and measurements
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API

## Implementation Notes
- Start with types and interfaces first
- Use Go idioms for resource representation
- Consider future extensibility for new resource types
- Add comprehensive validation for resource values

Implement cross-platform system resource monitoring to gather real-time CPU, memory, and I/O statistics for resource-aware scheduling decisions.

## Background
Resource-aware scheduling requires accurate, real-time information about system resource availability. This must work across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.

## Requirements
- [ ] Implement cross-platform resource monitoring (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Add caching layer for metrics (avoid excessive syscalls)
- [ ] Benchmark monitoring overhead (<0.1% CPU usage)
- [ ] Add integration tests for each platform

## Technical Details
**Files to create:**
- `resources/system_monitor.go` - Common interface and logic
- `resources/system_monitor_linux.go` - Linux implementation using /proc
- `resources/system_monitor_darwin.go` - macOS implementation using syscall
- `resources/system_monitor_windows.go` - Windows implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Linux monitoring works using /proc/stat, /proc/meminfo, /proc/diskstats
- [ ] macOS monitoring works using syscall and IOKit
- [ ] Windows monitoring works using WMI or Performance Counters
- [ ] Caching layer prevents excessive syscalls
- [ ] Monitoring overhead is <0.1% CPU usage
- [ ] Integration tests pass on all supported platforms
- [ ] Graceful fallback when platform-specific features unavailable

## Implementation Notes
- Use build tags for platform-specific code
- Implement exponential backoff for failed monitoring calls
- Cache results with appropriate TTL based on resource type
- Handle monitoring failures gracefully
- Consider using existing libraries like gopsutil for complex platforms""",

Extend the existing Task struct to support resource requirements and provide a fluent builder API for easy task configuration.

## Background
Tasks need to specify their resource requirements for intelligent scheduling. A builder API makes this configuration intuitive and prevents errors.

- [ ] Extend existing Task struct with resource requirements
- [ ] Implement fluent builder API for task configuration
- [ ] Add validation for resource requirements
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

- [ ] Resource requirements are validated before task creation
- [ ] Existing code continues to work without modification
- [ ] Builder API supports all resource types
- [ ] Unit tests cover all builder methods

- Validate resource values are positive and within reasonable bounds
- Consider adding convenience methods for common resource patterns
