# Phase 7: Testing and Documentation Issues (Week 13-14)

## Issue #28: Add comprehensive testing suite with chaos testing

**Type**: enhancement  
**Priority**: high  
**Labels**: phase7, testing, chaos, integration, benchmarks  
**Milestone**: Phase 7 - Testing and Documentation  
**Assignees**: (to be assigned)  

### Description
Create a comprehensive testing suite that covers all resource-aware scheduling features, includes performance benchmarks, and implements chaos testing for production readiness.

### Background
Production systems require thorough testing to ensure reliability under various conditions. Chaos testing helps identify failure modes and resilience issues.

### Requirements
- [ ] Add integration tests for all features
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add chaos/stress tests
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage

### Technical Details
**Files to create:**
- `tests/integration_test.go` - Integration test suite
- `tests/benchmark_test.go` - Performance benchmarks
- `tests/chaos_test.go` - Chaos and stress testing

**Key test scenarios:**
```go
// File: tests/integration_test.go
func TestResourceExhaustion(t *testing.T)
func TestBinPackingEfficiency(t *testing.T)
func TestLearningConvergence(t *testing.T)
func TestDefragmentation(t *testing.T)

// File: tests/benchmark_test.go
func BenchmarkSchedulingOverhead(b *testing.B)
func BenchmarkResourceTracking(b *testing.B)
func BenchmarkBinPacking(b *testing.B)

// File: tests/chaos_test.go
func TestRandomTaskFailures(t *testing.T)
func TestResourceSpikes(t *testing.T)
func TestWorkerCrashes(t *testing.T)
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All resource-aware features have integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable overhead
- [ ] Chaos tests identify failure modes and recovery
- [ ] Code coverage exceeds 80% for new code
- [ ] Tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance regression tests catch degradations
- [ ] Chaos tests can be run in controlled environments

### Implementation Notes
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Implement test fixtures for consistent test data
- Use test containers for integration testing
- Add performance regression detection
- Consider property-based testing for complex scenarios

## Issue #29: Create comprehensive documentation and examples

**Type**: enhancement  
**Priority**: high  
**Labels**: phase7, documentation, examples, guides  
**Milestone**: Phase 7 - Testing and Documentation  
**Assignees**: (to be assigned)  

### Description
Create comprehensive documentation, code examples, and migration guides to help users adopt and effectively use the resource-aware scheduling features.

### Background
Good documentation is essential for user adoption and community growth. Examples and guides help users understand best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

### Requirements
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add code examples for all features
- [ ] Create migration guide from other pools
- [ ] Add architecture diagrams

### Technical Details
**Files to create:**
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Quick start guide
- `docs/resource-aware-scheduling.md` - Feature documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API documentation
- `docs/best-practices.md` - Usage guidelines
- `docs/migration-guide.md` - Migration from other pools

**Examples to create:**
- `examples/basic/main.go` - Basic usage
- `examples/resource-limits/main.go` - Resource limits
- `examples/auto-learning/main.go` - Auto-learning
- `examples/kubernetes/deployment.yaml` - K8s deployment
- `examples/cost-optimization/main.go` - Cost optimization

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation covers all features comprehensively
- [ ] Code examples demonstrate real-world usage
- [ ] Migration guide helps users transition smoothly
- [ ] Architecture diagrams explain system design
- [ ] Documentation is searchable and well-organized
- [ ] Examples run successfully and are tested
- [ ] Best practices guide prevents common mistakes

### Implementation Notes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code snippets for all major features
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Consider video tutorials for complex concepts
- Implement documentation versioning
