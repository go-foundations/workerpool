**Assignees**: (to be assigned)  

### Description

- [ ] Add lookahead queue for better packing
- [ ] Benchmark against simple scheduling

### Technical Details
**Files to create:**
- `scheduler/binpacking/types.go` - Core bin packing structures

**Key structures:**
```go
type BinPackingScheduler struct {
    dimensions  []ResourceType
    algorithm   PackingAlgorithm
    lookahead   int
}

type PackingAlgorithm interface {
    Pack(tasks []*Task, workers []*WorkerBin) []Assignment
}

type WorkerBin struct {
    ID        string
    Capacity  ResourceRequirement
    Allocated ResourceRequirement
    Tasks     []*Task
}

// File: scheduler/binpacking/algorithms.go

## Issue #20: Implement intelligent priority queue with dynamic scoring

**Type**: enhancement  
**Priority**: high  
**Labels**: phase4, algorithms, queue, priority, optimization  
**Milestone**: Phase 4 - Advanced Scheduling Algorithms  
**Assignees**: (to be assigned)  

### Description
Implement an intelligent priority queue that dynamically re-scores tasks based on multiple factors to optimize scheduling decisions.

### Background
Static priority queues don't adapt to changing system conditions. Dynamic scoring provides better resource utilization and fairness.

### Requirements
- [ ] Implement priority queue with dynamic re-scoring
- [ ] Add multiple scoring strategies (ResourceEfficiency, WaitTime, Deadline)
- [ ] Add queue metrics (wait time, queue depth)
- [ ] Add tests for queue behavior under load

### Technical Details
**Files to create:**
- `scheduler/queue/priority_queue.go` - Core priority queue implementation
- `scheduler/queue/scorers.go` - Multiple scoring strategies

**Key structures:**
```go
type PriorityQueue struct {
    items    []*QueueItem
    scorer   PriorityScorer
    mu       sync.RWMutex
}

type QueueItem struct {
    Task      *Task
    Priority  float64
    EnqueuedAt time.Time
    Attempts  int
}

type PriorityScorer interface {
    Score(item *QueueItem, state *SchedulerState) float64
}

// File: scheduler/queue/scorers.go
type ResourceEfficiencyScorer struct{} // Prioritize tasks that use resources efficiently
type WaitTimeScorer struct{}          // Consider how long task has been waiting
type DeadlineScorer struct{}          // Priority based on deadline
type CompositePriorityScorer struct { // Combine multiple scoring strategies
    scorers []PriorityScorer
    weights []float64
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Priority queue supports dynamic re-scoring
- [ ] Multiple scoring strategies implemented and tested
- [ ] Queue metrics provide actionable insights
- [ ] Queue behavior is predictable under load
- [ ] Scoring strategies can be combined and weighted
- [ ] Performance overhead of re-scoring is acceptable

### Implementation Notes
- Use heap data structure for efficient priority operations
- Implement lazy re-scoring to minimize overhead
